# Disney-Movies-and-Box-Office-Success

Assignment done for a Data Mining course taken Spring 2025 provided via Data Camp.

This project analyzes a dataset of Disney movies to explore the relationship between various factors (e.g., budget, genre, release date) and box office revenue.

We attempt to create a linear model that can predict the box office success of a Disney movie based on its features.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [source]. It contains information such as movie title, release date, budget, genre, and worldwide gross revenue.

The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn, feature selection, and building linear regression models.

Steps taken included data loading, cleaning, generating line plots, and regression fitting.

This project uses the following Python libraries: **pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn**.
